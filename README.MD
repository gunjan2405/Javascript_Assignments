Let's understand the basics of JS and implement few higher order functions as a part of this exercise. 
Write logic without using in-built function.

1. map
2. filter
3. reduce
4. forEach


Each of the above function takes 2 parameters. A list of numbers and a callback function that gets executed on the list.
